# This file contains my work for my ENGG 200 Maze Runner Project!

This was my first time ever developing any sort of major code for a project and was done in my first year of engineering.
We were tasked with creating a fully functioning retro game console, and while my colleagues were tasked with constructing
the mechanical components, I was tasked with making the game itself on Arduino IDE.

The game we decided to develop was a maze game, where the user was tasked with navigating a randomly generated maze with a 
joystick while avoiding all the outer edges of the maze. After completing five levels, the player had completed the game and 
was congratulated by a success screen!

This projects consisted of multiple components such as:
```
1. Creating Random Maze Generator
2. Building the User Interface
3. Coding the Sprite for the Player
4. Collision Detection
5. Level Screens and Menu Screen
6. Programming Pins from the Arduino into the game
```

All of these aspects combined to make a functional final product, that was then presented in our class to a panel of judges, 
who gave us an A+ for our work.
